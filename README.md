# Low-Poly-Character

This Low Poly Character project is a project where we will be creating a simple character, in my case my Dungeons and Dragons character, Arwynn Blackpowder. This character will be modelled in Blender, where it will also be rigged and animated using armature and bones. We are creating this character to be put into a game development project later in the year.
